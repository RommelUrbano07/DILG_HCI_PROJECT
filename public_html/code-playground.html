            <strong style="display:block;margin-bottom:10px;">Answer :&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The Local Governance Support Program for Local Economic Development (LGSP-LED) is an 8-year collaborative project of the Governments of Canada and the

            enhance local governance and economic development.<br>
            <br>
            The goal of the project is to foster efficient, responsive, transparent and accountable governance at all levels. Its purpose is to reduce poverty by strengthening local governance and supporting sustainable Local Economic Development
            (LED). The Program operates both at the national and local levels, providing a better enabling environment for LGUs and improved prospects for local economic development in various communities.

          <p style="padding:0;margin:0;">
            <strong style="display:block;margin-bottom:10px;">Answer :&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>At the national level, LGSP-LED will improve the enabling environment for decentralization and local governance, with a focus on how this supports local
            economic development. It will also address ways to improve the coordination and rationalization of LED approaches in the country.<br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, LGSP-LED's work at the local level will provide support to participating LGUs in developing and implementing their local economic development approaches. The intention is to build the capacity of LGUs to pursue
            innovative LED methods that can produce important job creation, generate economic results for women and men, and improve the governance environment support for economic development.<br>
            <br>
            The strong public-private partnership that would emerge under the Project will provide LGUs and their alliances the means to adopt area-wide, long-term integrated LED strategies focused on creative and sustainable solutions in response to
            local circumstances.

          <ol>
            <li> Fostering the revered Filipino tradition of bayanihan, which is the spirit of cohesive effort where shared challenges are addressed through the strength of unity, cooperation and, partnership in the local communities;</li><br>
            <li> Flexibility to allow the work with LGUs to be demand-driven. It is anticipated that this will result in a range of LED models being supported and responsive to the needs and requirements of the LED stakeholders;</li><br>
            <li> Cost-shared and performance based initiatives.</li><br>
            <li> Use of existing resources in the Philippines to support LED activities allowing more sustainable relationships to be built with LGUs. This could include tapping Local Resources partners(e.g. consultants, NGOs, academe, etc) to
              provide technical assistance, facilitating the identification and accessing of financing channels for LGUS, and mobilizing the local community to play an active role in the LED process;</li><br>
            <li> LED interventions based on sound market principles with a solid assessment of the feasibility of achieving intended results and making them economically and environmentally sustainable;</li><br>
            <li> Inclusion of informal enterprises in the LED process, including the planning and implementation of LED initiatives and in investment programming;</li><br>
            <li> A LED planning process that is harmonized with established LGU planning systems and processes for a coherent enabling environment;</li><br>
            <li> Mainstreaming of gender equality, environmental sustainability and poverty reduction concerns;</li><br>
            <li> An inclusive process that brings in all key stakeholders that have an interest in and ability to contribute to LED;</li><br>
            <li> An approach focused not only on growth, but also on sustainable development and social justice.</li><br>

            <strong style="display:block;margin-bottom:10px;">Answer :&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>In 2008, a DILG Project Management Team (PMT) was created. The PMT facilitated the conduct of a series of consultative meetings and workshops with LED
            practitioners and partners form other NGAs, the private sector, NGOs, the academe and the donor community to conduct an inventory of existing programs, projects and activities and series that supports local economic development and the
            development of the logical framework and project implementation plan for LGSP-LED. To date, through a competitive process, four LGU alliances were selected for Phase I: The Province of Guimaras Agri-Tourism Alliance, the
            Dapitan-Dipolog-Polanco-Katipunan-Pres. M. Roxas-Manukan (DDPKaRoMa) Growth Corridor in the Province of Zamboanga del Norte, One Pangasinan Alliance of LGUs (OPAL) in the Province of Pangasinan, and the Province of Bohol Integrated Area
            Development Cluster V (BIAD). A series of capacity development workshops and consultative dialogues with the participating LGU alliances in the planning and implementation of priority LED initiatives have also been completed. In June,
            LGSP-LED intends to hold national and provincial launches. During the national launching, the MOA between DILG, the CEA and the four participating LGU alliances will be signed.

          <p style="padding:0;margin:0;">
            <strong style="display:block;margin-bottom:10px;">Answer :&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Competitive LGUs are those that have advanced the LED process and would require additional support to further enabling environment for LED. They are targets of
            Phase 1, which will cover initial 15 months (2008-2010). It will focus on strengthening the LED programming and partnership arrangements of selected four (4) eligible LGU alliances.<br>
            <br>
            The lessons learned and experience gained during this Phase will serve to guide the succeeding phases of LGSP-LED implementation. It is also intended to inform CIDA and DILG on whether the LGUs should continue into the longer term phase
            and/or attract more LGUs into the Project.
